# Summary

- The Point class is responsible for calculating distances to other points on
the globe. I'm using BigDecimal numbers with large enough precision that the 
distance errors should be minimal, especially considering that the use case does
not actually need these calculations to be that precise (there is very little 
customer or business risk in having a small amount of error in the calculation).
In terms of validation I'm keeping it fairly simple using the assumption that the
values passed in are at least strings, integers or floats (BigDecimal handles the
conversion) and validate that the values are within sensible ranges.

- The customer details class handles extracting customer information from a data
source (in this instance only from a file) and handles validating that the format
is correct and again has fairly light validation (checks that the keys are there
and that the JSON is parseable) because I'm assuming that the customer details
 file is either generated by a machine and fairly reliable or that there is a 
human involved that can read the error message and correct the offending entry.

- The CustomerFinder is the entry point to the script and puts together the other
objecs in order to find the customers that match the constraints. There is an
option parser which I added mostly for convenience as I'm not certain which way
this script is meant to be used.

# Usage

You can try out the code from the console. Run

`ruby lib/customer_finder.rb --lat <office_lat> --lon <office_long> --path <user_file_path> --distance <distance_in_km>`

In the case of the specified example you can run:

`ruby ./lib/customer_finder.rb --lat 53.3393 --lon -6.2576841 --path spec/feature/users.txt --distance 100`

This will output a list of customer ids next to customer names that fits the
constraints.

# Running the tests

To run the tests, first install the dependencies

`bundle install`

Then run rspec to execue the tests

`bundle exec rspec`
