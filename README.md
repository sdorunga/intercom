# Welcome to my submission

Both code submissions were coded in Ruby since it's the language I enjoy writing
the most, although it's not the language I currently use at work (which is Java)
I think it should be idiomatic if I haven't gotten too rusty at Ruby. All the
code should work on any modern version of Ruby (post 2.0).

All the code was written using TDD and done to what I would consider production
level quality (proportional to the information I was given on intended usage,
audience and performance requirements). Further details on specific technical
decisions are on both submissions' respective READMEs which you can click through
to below. In order to run the examples just `cd` into either of the directories
and follow the instructions.
